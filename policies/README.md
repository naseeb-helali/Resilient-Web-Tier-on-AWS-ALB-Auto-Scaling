| `tagging-guidelines.md` | Defines required AWS resource tags, their format, and governance practices. |

## Purpose
Tagging is not just a naming convention â€” it is a **governance mechanism**.  
It ensures traceability, cost visibility, and accountability for all IaC-managed resources.

> In Phase-2, this policy will be enforced via automated compliance checks in CI/CD.
